# Fraud-Detection

Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using a Kaggle dataset,
with a focus on data handling, model training, evaluation, and explainability. Implementing an
unsupervised model will be given higher preference to showcase skills in handling
unlabelled data and anomaly detection.
